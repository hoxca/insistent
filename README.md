# Insistent

Insistent must wake up kosmodrom teamates in case of non recoverable error in the observatory.
Insistent use SIP signaling to make phone call in case of emmergency.

It use baresip under the hood to avoid managing the complex sip protocol stack.
Insistent is cross compiled for the windows platform as it will be used in the Voyager dragscript sequencer

Insistent will try to call and hangup before the answering machine of the callee take control.
It will try 3 times, before passing to the next teammate.

If insistent came to play; we must wake up somebody in the middle of the night !!!

# Usage

That's a TODO as far as we are on the initial poc.
baresip Mock should be removed after code stabilisation.

we need a configuration documentation also !
